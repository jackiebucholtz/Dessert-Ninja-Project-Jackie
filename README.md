# Dessert Ninja
## Jackie and Bella
Hey queens!! This is our perfect, awesome, cool , and bestest project ever. It is a spin off of Fruit Ninja, a video game where fruit is sliced and bombs are dodged in order to win. In Dessert Ninja, you are collecting all of the delectable sweets. Refrain from the demise of the broccoli.

## How to Play
In order to play Dessert Ninja, you must swipe your mouse across the donut, cupcake, and/or cookie to gain points. Slicing the broccoli equates to an explosion and loss. But do not fear, you are welcome to click the screen and play again!

### Usage:
Swipe the mouse across objects.

When end screen appears, click mouse to start again.

## Classes
### Donut Class:
This class is for the donut object which you slice through to gain points. It was made from Pixilart with our amazing artistic skills.

### Background Class:
One background class was created to duplicate the background from the original fruit ninja game.

# Our Code
## Frame:

### Creating Objects:
This is where we create our objects that are displayed during the game. The wood background, danny devito gif, donut, cupcake, cookie, and broccoli.

### Paint Method:
This method calls the objects into display.

#### Scoring:
This code ensures that if a dessert is not already hovered over, then it will be sliced and the point will increase by one. Hovering over the broccoli, however, does not increase your score. Instead, the score resets to zero and the End Screen appears.

### Collision:
In all of our dessert classes, we have a similar area of code like the one below. For this cupcake class, if our mouse hovers over the hitbox area, then the cupcake gets sliced. The same goes for all other objects. It is called in the frame class under scoring as we can see above.

### Game Over:
This is a portion of our Endscreen class. When you hover your mouse over the broccoli

## Unique Features of Our Game  
In the original game, an explosion occurs when you slice the bomb instead of the fruit. When the broccoli is sliced in Dessert Ninja, a gif of Danny Devito walking from an explosion appears as money falls down from the sky above. Here is a reference to the legend himself below:
