# Dessert Ninja
## Jackie and Bella
Hey queens!!! This is our perfect, awesome, and cool game. It is undoubtedly the bestest CSA project ever. It is similar to Fruit Ninja, a video game where fruit is sliced and bombs are dodged in order to win. We wanted to make the game our own through a sweet spin-off of the objects in the game. In Dessert Ninja, you are collecting all of the delectable sweets, but be sure to refrain from the demise of the broccoli.

## How to Play
In order to play Dessert Ninja, you must swipe your mouse across the donut, cupcake, and/or cookie to gain points. Slicing the broccoli equates to an explosion and loss. But do not fear, you are welcome to click the screen and play again!

### Usage:
Swipe your cursor across objects as they appear on the screen in order to gain points. Each dessert sliced is one point added.

When end screen appears, click mouse to start again.

## Classes
### Donut Class:
This class is for the donut object which you slice through to gain points. It was made from Pixilart with our amazing artistic skills.

### Cupcake Class:
This class is for the cupcake object which you slice through to gain points. It was made from Pixilart with our amazing artistic skills.

### Cookie Class:
This class is for the cookie object which you slice through to gain points. It was made from Pixilart with our amazing artistic skills.

### Broccoli Class:
This class is for the broccoli object which if you slice through you lose the game. It was made from Pixilart with our amazing artistic skills.

### Background Class:
One background class was created to replicate the background from the original fruit ninja game.

# Our Code

## Creating Objects:
This is where we create our objects that are displayed during the game. The wood background, danny devito gif, donut, cupcake, cookie, and broccoli.

## Paint Method:
This method allows the objects that we created to be displayed in our game. Hence why they are called in the paint method, to paint the objects onto the screen.

### Scoring:
This code says that if an object hasn't already been sliced then slice it. When it recognizes that the object has been sliced it adds one point to the score. Slicing the broccoli, however, does not increase your score. Instead, the score resets to zero and displays the End Screen.

## Collision:
In all of our dessert classes, we have a similar area of code like the one below. For this cupcake class, if our mouse hovers over the hitbox area, then the cupcake gets sliced. The same goes for all other objects. It is called in the frame class under scoring as we can see above.

## Game Over:
This is a portion of our Endscreen class. When you slice the broccoli the score resets to 0 and the end screen displays as well as text that indicates that the game has ended and prompts you to click the screen to play again. This portion of code is how we are able to display the Danny Devito gif.

## Unique Features of Our Game  
In the original game, an explosion occurs when you slice the bomb instead of the fruit. When the broccoli is sliced in Dessert Ninja, a gif of Danny Devito walking from an explosion appears as money falls down from the sky above. Here is a reference to the legend himself below:

## Support & Roadmap
For support, reach out to Bella or Jackie (but Mr. David would probably be the most helpful). We do not plan on actively updating our game in the future, but do think it would be cool to integrate a wider variety objects such as new desserts or different vegetables. One of our initial goals for the project was to create three strikes to equate a loss, one for each time you slice the broccoli, rather than just one broccoli ending the game. I think that this would ensure that the game could last longer for players.



## Authors and Acknowledgement
### THANK YOU!
All of our objects were created by ourselves on PixelArt. The background and Danny Devito gif are found on Google. This game was inspired by Fruit Ninja. Thanks to everyone who helped contribute to the success of our game!
